"""One list of folders for downloads and the media engine.

Each row in ``download_paths`` can be a place qBittorrent downloads into
(``downloads``), a place the media engine scans and encodes (``scan``), or both.
qBittorrent may see a folder under a different path than this container does, so
a row keeps both: ``path`` as qBittorrent sees it, and ``local_path`` here. When
``local_path`` is empty it comes from the path mappings.

The media engine's folder list (``media.config.MEDIA_PATHS``) is derived from
the scanned rows by ``refresh()``. It used to be its own setting (``media_paths``,
or ``MEDIA_PATHS`` in .env); ``merge_once()`` folds that into these rows on
upgrade, and ``adopt_env()`` picks up folders added later with setup.sh --media.
